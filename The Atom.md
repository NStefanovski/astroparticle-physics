# Study Guide

## 2.1 The Atom

**Mendeleev's Periodic Table:**
- Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the 63 known elements by atomic mass.
- Observed that elements with similar properties recur periodically.
- Predicted the existence and properties of undiscovered elements.
- Modern periodic table is organized by atomic number (number of protons/electrons), not atomic mass.

**Atomic Structure:**
- Atoms consist of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons.
- Electrons occupy shells or energy levels; the nth shell can hold up to \(2n^2\) electrons.
- The outermost shell determines an element's chemical properties.

## 2.2 The Rutherford Experiment

**Objective:**
- To understand the inner structure of the atom.

**Method:**
- Ernest Rutherford's team directed alpha particles at a thin gold foil.
- Observed scattering patterns using a scintillating screen.

**Findings:**
- Most alpha particles passed through with little deflection.
- A small fraction deflected at large angles (>90°).
- Concluded that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus.

**Rutherford Scattering Formula:**
- Describes how alpha particles scatter off nuclei.
- Based on Coulomb's law and classical mechanics.

## 2.3 Inside the Nuclei: β Decay and the Neutrino

**Beta Decay:**
- Process where a nucleus emits an electron (β particle).
- Observed continuous energy spectrum of emitted electrons.

**Neutrino Hypothesis:**
- Wolfgang Pauli proposed the neutrino to conserve energy and momentum in beta decay.
- Neutrino is a neutral, nearly massless particle.
- Enrico Fermi developed the theory of beta decay incorporating the neutrino.

**Discovery:**
- Neutrinos were experimentally detected in 1956 by Cowan and Reines.
- Used inverse beta decay reactions near a nuclear reactor.

## 2.4 A Look into the Quantum World: Schrödinger's Equation

**Schrödinger's Wave Equation:**
- Fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
- Describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.

**Properties of Wavefunctions:**
- The wavefunction \(\Psi\) provides probability amplitudes.
- Probability density: \(|\Psi(x, t)|^2\) gives the likelihood of finding a particle at position \(x\) and time \(t\).

**Operators and Measurements:**
- Physical observables are represented by Hermitian operators.
- Measurement outcomes are eigenvalues of these operators.
- Operators do not generally commute, leading to uncertainty principles.

**Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:**
- Used for systems with time-independent potentials.
- Solutions provide energy eigenstates.

## 2.5 Uncertainty and the Scale of Measurements

**Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**
- It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.
- \(\Delta x \Delta p \geq \dfrac{\hbar}{2}\)
- Smaller scales require higher energies to probe due to this principle.

**Implications for Particle Physics:**
- Probing smaller distances necessitates particles with higher energies.
- Particle accelerators and cosmic rays provide high-energy particles for such investigations.

## 2.6 The Description of Scattering: Cross Section and Interaction Length

**Cross Section (\(\sigma\)):**
- Measure of the probability of a specific interaction between particles.
- Total cross section: \(\sigma_{\text{tot}} = \dfrac{N_{\text{int}}}{n_{\text{beam}}}\)
- Differential cross section: \(\dfrac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\) describes how scattering varies with angle.

**Luminosity (\(L\)):**
- Number of particles per unit area per unit time in a collider.
- Interaction rate: \(W_{\text{int}} = \sigma_{\text{tot}} L\)

**Interaction Length (\(L_{\text{int}}\)):**
- Average distance a particle travels in a material before interacting.
- \(L_{\text{int}} = \dfrac{1}{n \sigma_{\text{tot}}}\), where \(n\) is the number density of target particles.

## 2.7 Description of Decay: Width and Lifetime

**Exponential Decay Law:**
- The number of undecayed particles decreases exponentially over time.
- \(N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\tau}\)

**Decay Width (\(\Gamma\)) and Lifetime (\(\tau\)):**
- Inversely related: \(\tau = \dfrac{\hbar}{\Gamma}\)
- Decay width represents the uncertainty in the particle's energy.

**Breit-Wigner Distribution:**
- Describes the energy distribution of an unstable particle.
- \(|\Psi(E)|^2 \propto \dfrac{1}{(E - E_0)^2 + (\Gamma/2)^2}\)

## 2.8 Fermi's Golden Rule and Rutherford Scattering

**Fermi's Golden Rule:**
- Provides the transition rate between quantum states due to a perturbation.
- \(\lambda = \dfrac{2\pi}{\hbar} |H_{fi}|^2 \rho(E)\)

**Application to Scattering:**
- Transition amplitude (\(H_{fi}\)) calculated using perturbation theory.
- Density of final states (\(\rho(E)\)) accounts for available energy states.
- Quantum mechanical derivation of Rutherford's scattering formula confirms classical results.
