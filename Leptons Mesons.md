# Study Guide

## 3.2.4 The μ Lepton and the π Mesons

### Yukawa's Theory of the Strong Force
- **Hideki Yukawa** proposed in 1935 that the strong nuclear force is mediated by a particle.
- Predicted a **meson** (meaning "middle one") with a mass around **one-tenth of a GeV** (~100 MeV).
- The meson would explain the rapid decrease of the strong force with distance.

### Discovery of the Mesotron (Muon)
- **Carl Anderson** and **Seth Neddermeyer** observed in 1937 a new particle in cosmic rays.
- Named it the **mesotron**, later known as the **muon (μ)**.
- Muon mass measured between **200 and 240 times the electron mass** (~105 MeV/c²).
- Initially thought to be Yukawa's meson due to its intermediate mass.

### Lifetime Measurements and the Muon Puzzle
- **Bruno Rossi** measured the muon's lifetime (~2 microseconds) at different altitudes.
- Found muons decay into electrons and neutrinos, inconsistent with strong force carriers.
- Muons were too penetrating and had too long a lifetime to be Yukawa's predicted meson.

### The Experiment of Conversi, Pancini, and Piccioni
- **Ettore Pancini**, **Marcello Conversi**, and **Oreste Piccioni** conducted an experiment in 1945-46.
- Showed that negative muons are not absorbed by nuclei as expected for strong force carriers.
- Demonstrated that the mesotron (muon) is not the particle predicted by Yukawa.

### Discovery of the Pion (π Meson)
- **Cecil Powell**, **Giuseppe Occhialini**, and **César Lattes** discovered the charged pion in 1947.
- Used nuclear emulsions exposed to cosmic rays at high altitudes (Mount Chacaltaya).
- **Pions** have a mass of about **140 MeV/c²**.
- Decay into muons, confirming a two-step decay process: π → μ → e.

### The Muon as a Lepton
- Muon is similar to the electron but with greater mass (~105 MeV/c²).
- Does not participate in strong interactions; classified as a **lepton**.
- The muon decay involves neutrinos, indicating the existence of lepton families.

## 3.2.4.1 The Neutral Pion

### Prediction and Discovery
- Charge symmetry in nuclear forces suggested a neutral meson should exist.
- **Neutral pion (π⁰)** is electrically neutral and more challenging to detect.
- Short lifetime (~10⁻¹⁶ s), decays primarily into two photons: π⁰ → γ + γ.
- Detected indirectly through its decay products in particle showers.

## 3.2.5 Strange Particles

### Observation of Strange Particles
- In 1947, unexpected particle tracks with "V" shapes were observed in cosmic rays.
- **George Rochester** and **Clifford Butler** identified neutral particles decaying into charged pions.
- Particles had masses around **500 MeV/c²**, intermediate between pions and protons.

### Characteristics of Strange Particles
- Produced in high-energy interactions, but with relatively long lifetimes (~10⁻¹⁰ s).
- Behaved inconsistently with expectations for strongly interacting particles.

### Introduction of Strangeness
- Particles always produced in pairs, suggesting a new conserved quantum number: **strangeness**.
- **Strange mesons (K mesons or kaons)** and **strange baryons (hyperons like Λ, Σ)** were identified.
- Strangeness conservation explained their production and decay patterns.
